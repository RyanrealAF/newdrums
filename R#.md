# R#: Free Visual Software That Reads MIDI

## Overview

R# is a hypothetical visual programming language or framework designed for real-time audio-visual performance and interactive media. This document outlines how R# could be used with MIDI files generated by the audio-to-MIDI conversion tool in this project.

## Key Features

- Node-based visual programming interface
- Real-time MIDI input/output support
- Audio-reactive visual generation
- Support for various visual effects and animations
- OSC (Open Sound Control) communication
- Virtual camera/NDI output for OBS integration

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Download R# from the official website
2. Install the application following the on-screen instructions
3. Launch R# and familiarize yourself with the interface

### Loading MIDI Files

1. Open R# and create a new project
2. Add a MIDI file input node to the canvas
3. Configure the node to load the MIDI file generated by `audio_to_midi.py`
4. Connect the MIDI node to visual effect nodes to create reactive animations

### Example Workflow

```
MIDI File Input → Note On/Off Detector → Color Changer → Screen Output
```

## MIDI to Visual Mapping

R# allows for flexible mapping between MIDI events and visual parameters. Some common mappings include:

- **Note On**: Trigger a visual event (e.g., flash, particle burst)
- **Note Off**: End a visual event (e.g., fade out)
- **Velocity**: Control visual intensity (e.g., brightness, size)
- **Note Number**: Control visual color or shape
- **Pitch Bend**: Control visual position or rotation

## Integration with OBS

To use R# visuals in OBS:

1. Install the NDI plugin for OBS
2. In R#, enable NDI output
3. In OBS, add a new NDI source
4. Select the R# NDI stream from the list

## Advanced Usage

### Dynamic Visual Generation

R# supports dynamic visual generation based on MIDI patterns. For example:

```
MIDI File Input → Beat Detector → Particle Emitter → 3D Rotation → Screen Output
```

### Audio-Reactive MIDI

Combine audio analysis with MIDI generation for enhanced visuals:

```
Audio Input → Onset Detector → MIDI Note Generator → Visual Effect Chain → Screen Output
```

- [R# Official Documentation](https://example.com/rsharp/docs)
- [R# Community Forum](https://example.com/rsharp/forum)
- [MIDI Visualization Tutorials](https://example.com/rsharp/tutorials/midi)

## Compatibility

R# is compatible with MIDI files generated by this project. The default MIDI note (36/Kick Drum) works well for triggering percussion-based visuals.

## Troubleshooting

- **MIDI file not loading**: Check that the MIDI file path is correct and the file is not corrupted
- **Visuals not triggering**: Verify the MIDI event to visual parameter mapping
- **Performance issues**: Reduce the number of active visual effects or lower the resolution

## Future Development

- Support for additional MIDI event types (e.g., pitch bend, control change)
- Advanced audio analysis features (e.g., frequency tracking, beat detection)
- 3D visual rendering capabilities
- Integration with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) platforms
